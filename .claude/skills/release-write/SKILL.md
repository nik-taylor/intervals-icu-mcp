## Context

This repo's release path is half-manual:

| Step | Trigger | Workflow |
|---|---|---|
| Push `chore(release): X.Y.Z` to main | `push.branches: main` | `release.yml` → Docker build/push |
| Push tag `vX.Y.Z` | (none) | nothing |
| Create GitHub Release on the tag | `release.types: [published]` | `publish.yml` → PyPI + MCP Registry |

**Creating the GitHub Release is what actually triggers PyPI publish.** It is not optional. CHANGELOG.md is manual (per CLAUDE.md). This skill writes the GitHub Release body so users opening the Releases tab or the PyPI project page see polished notes, not raw commit history.

## Prerequisites

- The release commit (`chore(release): X.Y.Z`) is already on `origin/main` — i.e. CHANGELOG.md has been renamed from `[Unreleased]` to `[X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD`, committed, and pushed.
- `make can-release` is green.
- You are on `main`, up to date with `origin/main`.
- **`server.json` `description` is ≤ 100 chars.** The MCP Registry rejects longer descriptions with HTTP 422 (`expected length <= 100`), failing the `mcp-registry` job *after* PyPI has already published — a partial release that's annoying to recover. Pre-flight check: `jq -r '.description | length' server.json`. If it's over 100, stop and get it trimmed on `main` first.

If any prereq is missing, stop and tell the user what to do first.

## Instructions

### 1. Extract the CHANGELOG section for this version

Find the start line of `## [X.Y.Z]` and the start line of the *next* version section below it. Read everything in between, dropping the leading `## [...] — date` heading line (GitHub uses the release title instead).

```bash
# Example for v3.0.0:
awk '/^## \[3\.0\.0\]/{flag=1; next} /^## \[/{flag=0} flag' CHANGELOG.md
```

Save the extracted body to a temp file (e.g. `/tmp/release-notes-X.Y.Z.md`).

### 2. Reshape into the project's narrative style

**Critical:** the release notes are NOT a copy of the CHANGELOG section. The CHANGELOG is the exhaustive source-of-truth; the release body is a curated headline version. Past releases in this repo (v2.0.0, v1.3.0, v1.2.0) follow a narrative style — read 1-2 of them before drafting to anchor on the existing voice:

```bash
gh release view vPREVIOUS --json body --jq .body
```

Adopt these conventions:

- **Title has a tagline:** `vX.Y.Z – Headline Theme` (not plain `vX.Y.Z`). Same theme you'd put in a tweet.
  - **Default to one theme.** A second (`Theme One & Theme Two`) is allowed only when both are independently headline-worthy — the shape of v2.0.0 and v4.4.0. Don't reach for a second half to fill out the line; the best titles here are the single-theme ones (v4.3.2, v1.2.0). Aim for ≤ 45 chars including the `vX.Y.Z – ` prefix.
  - **Name the user's benefit, in the user's vocabulary.** No repo-internal process terms — "deferred cleanups", "the drained list", milestone or issue-tracker names. A reader on the Releases tab has no referent for them, and they describe maintainer bookkeeping rather than anything the reader's data now does differently. If a phrase would only parse to someone who has read CLAUDE.md, it fails.
  - **Breaking changes are not a headline theme.** Upgrade cost belongs in the `## Upgrading from vX.Y` section, not the title — even on a major.
  - Keep the shape flat: a noun phrase, optionally two joined by `&`. No trailing appositives or comma clauses (`… & The Deferred Cleanups, Drained` is the failure case).
- **Body uses narrative section headers**, not CHANGELOG-style category buckets. Examples from past releases: `## New features`, `## Improvements`, `## Notes`, or headline-named sections like `## Delete Safety Mode`. **DO NOT use `### Added / ### Fixed / ### Changed`** — that's CHANGELOG style; the release notes are different.
- **Body fits a hard word budget** (see step 3). Never size the notes as a percentage of the CHANGELOG — a long CHANGELOG is exactly when the notes must stay short.
- **Top callout (`> [!NOTE]`) only when there's a measured headline number** — token savings, accuracy gain, perf improvement. Skip for routine releases.
- **Inline upgrade prose** for breaking changes — one or two sentences, no diff blocks. Pattern from v2.0.0: *"Upgrading from 1.x: \<thing> no longer \<behavior>. Set \<env var> to restore."* For multiple breaking changes, a `## Upgrading from vX.Y` heading with prose paragraphs (NOT diff snippets unless the consumer audience is parsing-heavy — see below).
- **Single Full-Changelog comparison link at the bottom**, single line:
  ```markdown
  **Full Changelog:** https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/compare/v<PREVIOUS>...v<CURRENT>
  ```
  This replaces a hand-curated PR list. Don't list PRs unless the user explicitly asks for it.

**MCP-specific framing for response-shape changes:**

Per the narrowed SemVer contract (CHANGELOG header, adopted after 4.0.0), information-preserving response-shape changes (key renames, restructuring, added fields) are **minor**, not breaking. Only tool/parameter removals or renames, config env var semantic changes, default-registration changes, and removal of information from responses force a major. The reasoning:
- MCP responses are consumed by LLMs that rephrase into natural language.
- Programmatic parsers (`response["data"]["field"]`) are rare in MCP usage.
- A field rename usually doesn't break user-visible behavior; the LLM adapts.

When a release does include a breaking change — or a notable shape change worth flagging — keep the release-notes treatment proportional to the actual user impact: **one paragraph of inline upgrade prose, not an SDK-style Migration section with before/after diff blocks**. Diff blocks are for projects where consumers write typed parsing code; they're overkill here.

Don't:
- Rewrite the CHANGELOG verbatim. The CHANGELOG is comprehensive; the release notes are curated.
- Use CHANGELOG section headings (`### Added`, etc.) — that's the wrong genre.
- Add diff-snippet Migration sections for MCP response-shape changes — overkill for the audience.
- Add emojis unless the user explicitly asks for them (per project convention).
- Include co-author lines or AI attribution (per [feedback_commits.md] memory).

### 3. Cut it down — mandatory, not optional

Nobody reads long release notes. The first draft is always too long, because every fact
feels load-bearing while you're holding the whole diff in your head. It isn't: the CHANGELOG
is one click away and holds the evidence. **Run this pass every time, even when the draft
already feels tight.**

**Word budget** (body only, excluding the Full Changelog line) — measure it, don't estimate:

```bash
wc -w < /tmp/release-notes-X.Y.Z.md
```

| Release | Target | Hard ceiling |
|---|---|---|
| Patch (X.Y.**Z**) | ≤ 120 | 150 |
| Minor (X.**Y**.0) | ≤ 250 | 300 |
| Major (**X**.0.0, incl. upgrade section) | ≤ 350 | 400 |

Historical anchors: v2.0.0 = 192 words, v3.0.0 = 415, v4.0.0 = 182. A major that lands at
800 has failed this step. Per section: **one theme, ≤ 80 words**. More than four `##` sections
means you're listing, not curating — merge or drop.

**Over budget? Cut in this order** (each of these is CHANGELOG material, not release-notes material):

1. **Second and third supporting measurements.** One number per section earns its place; the rest prove a case nobody is disputing while reading a release page.
2. **Causal mechanism explained twice.** State the effect on the user, not the code path that produced it. "The model never declared the fields" is enough; the ordering of validation and response-building is not.
3. **Provenance and design justification** — why the semantics were established a certain way, which bug class it resembles, what was deliberately *not* changed and why.
4. **Sentences whose subject is the repo** rather than the user's data or tools ("This release drains…", "the list is now empty"). At most one, at the end.
5. **Adjacent-fact "worth knowing" notes.** True, interesting, and the reason a reader stops reading.

**Keep, always:** what broke, what it means for the reader's own data, the exact tool/field names to change, and the contributor credits.

Then re-read the trimmed draft and ask: *does it still say the same thing?* If a cut lost
information a user actually needs to act, restore that sentence — and take the words back
out somewhere else, not from the budget.

### 4. Show the polished notes to the user for review

Print the contents of the temp file **and its word count against the budget** (e.g. "312 words,
major budget 350"). The user may want to tweak before publishing. Wait for explicit go-ahead
before step 5.

### 5. Cut the release (only after user confirms)

```bash
# Create the tag (no automation; just a marker)
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z

# Create the GitHub Release using the polished notes file
# This is what triggers publish.yml → PyPI + MCP Registry
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z – <tagline>" --notes-file /tmp/release-notes-X.Y.Z.md
```

Do NOT use `--generate-notes` — that uses GitHub's auto-generated PR/commit list, which is noisier than what we just polished.

Do NOT use `--draft`. The release needs to be published to trigger `publish.yml`.

### 6. Verify the release published correctly

```bash
gh release view vX.Y.Z --json url,tagName,publishedAt
```

Report the URL to the user. Then watch the publish workflow to completion:

```bash
gh run watch "$(gh run list --workflow=publish.yml --limit=1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')" --exit-status
```

`publish.yml` has **two jobs**: `pypi` then `mcp-registry` (`needs: pypi`). Watch **both** — the registry job can fail *after* PyPI has published, leaving a partial release (PyPI live, registry missing). Don't report success off the PyPI job alone.

If it fails, surface the failure (`gh run view <id> --log-failed`) and stop — do not retry without user confirmation. Recovery notes:
- **Registry-only failure (PyPI already up):** re-running the CI run won't help — it's pinned to the original tag commit. Either (a) fix the cause on `main`, force-move the tag, and delete+recreate the Release to re-fire the workflow (the `pypi` job has `skip-existing: true`, so it no-ops on the already-published version), or (b) publish to the registry manually: download `mcp-publisher` from `modelcontextprotocol/registry`, `jq` the release version into `server.json`, `./mcp-publisher login github` (interactive device flow), `./mcp-publisher publish`.
- Confirm the registry entry landed: `curl -s "https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers?search=<pkg>" | jq '.servers[]?.version'`.

## Anti-patterns (don't do these)

- **Don't edit CHANGELOG.md from this skill.** The release commit is already on main; further edits create drift between the canonical changelog and the release body.
- **Don't tag without pushing the release commit first.** Tagging an older commit means the published artifact references stale CHANGELOG.
- **Don't auto-publish without showing the user the polished notes.** Even if the CHANGELOG looks fine, the polish step (TL;DR, PR list, migration guide) is judgment-based and the user should approve.
- **Don't use `--draft` then forget to publish.** `publish.yml` only fires on `release.types: [published]`, not on draft creation.
- **Don't generate "what's changed" via `--generate-notes` for a polished release.** That's GitHub's auto-listing; it's noisier and less narrative than the CHANGELOG section.
- **Don't skip step 3 because the draft "reads well".** Well-written and too long are the same failure here — the draft always reads well to the person who just wrote it. Measure the word count; if it's over budget, cut.
- **Don't let a big release justify a long body.** The reverse is true: the more that changed, the more selection the reader needs from you. A major with three themes gets three sections, not eight.

## Quality bar

The release body should answer three questions for a reader scanning the Releases tab:
1. **What changed at a glance?** — the callout, or the first section header.
2. **What do I need to know to upgrade?** — the tool and field names to change, as prose or a short list.
3. **Where did this come from?** — the Full Changelog comparison link.

If a reader can answer those without clicking into the CHANGELOG, the polish is sufficient — and anything beyond those three answers is a candidate for the cut pass. Avoid duplicating the CHANGELOG into a verbose PR list at the bottom; the comparison link is enough.
